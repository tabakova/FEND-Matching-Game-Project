Matching game rules

1. The cards in the deck are mixed.
2. Choose any two cards.
3. If the two cards match, they will stay opened.
4. If they don't match, they will turn back over.
5. Remember what was on each card and where it was.
6. The game is over when all the cards have been matched.


How I created the Memory Game

I used Vanilla JS to build this app, changed the html file a little and made some changes to the style too.
