Matching game rules

The cards in the deck are mixed.
Choose any two cards.
If the two cards match, they will stay opened.
If they don't match, they will turn back over.
Remember what was on each card and where it was.
The game is over when all the cards have been matched.


How I built the Memory Game

I used Vanilla JS to build this app, changed the html file a little and made some changes to the style too.

created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
create a pop-up modal when player wins game
